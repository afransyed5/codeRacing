 *         Problem 66: Diophantine equation
 * 
 *         Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
 * 
 *         x^2 – Dy^2 = 1
 * 
 *         For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649.649 – 13.180.180 =
 *         1.
 * 
 *         It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers
 *         when D is square.
 * 
 *         By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain
 *         the following:
 * 
 *         32 – 2×22 = 1 22 – 3×12 = 1 92 – 5×42 = 1 52 – 6×22 = 1 82 – 7×32 = 1
 * 
 *         Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x
 *         is obtained when D=5.
 * 
 *         Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the
 *         largest value of x is obtained.
