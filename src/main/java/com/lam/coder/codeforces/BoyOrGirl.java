 *
 *         Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in
 *         forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the
 *         first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat
 *         with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and
 *         eventually they became a couple in the network.
 * 
 *         But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out
 *         "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is
 *         too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize
 *         users' genders by their user names.
 * 
 *         This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's
 *         user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You
 *         are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero
 *         to determine the gender of this user by his method.
 * 
 *         Input The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only
 *         lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at
 *         most 100 letters.
 * 
 *         Output If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!"
 *         (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the
 *         quotes).
 * 
 *         Sample test(s) input wjmzbmr output CHAT WITH HER! input xiaodao
 *         output IGNORE HIM! input sevenkplus output CHAT WITH HER!
