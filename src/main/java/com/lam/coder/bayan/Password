You are going to add a feature to an online registration form, so that the users be able to see the security level of their chosen passwords. A password is a string of Latin English letters, digits and characters !@#$%^&*(). To determine the security level of a password, you should determine how many of the following conditions are satisfied:

The password contains at least one digit.
The password contains at least one Latin character.
The password contains at least one non-digit-non-Latin character.
The password contains at least 6 characters.
The password contains more than 10 characters.
The password contains at least one small and at least one capital Latin character.
All characters of the password are different. (Small and capital form of the same Latin character are considered different)
A password is considered weak, if less than four of the above conditions are met. A password is strong, if at least six of the above conditions are met. Otherwise, it is considered a normal password.

Write a program to determine the security level of some given passwords.

Input

The first line contains an integer T, number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by an empty line. The only line of each test case contains the password.

1≤T≤100
The password only contains characters a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9 and !@#$%^&*().
The length of the password is between 1 and 15, inclusive.
Output

For each test case, first output a line containing Case #x:, where x is the test case number, starting from 1. Then output a line containing the security level of the given password, either weak, normal or strong.
